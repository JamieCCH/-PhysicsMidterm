Midterm Assignment
Puzzle Based Platformer

The goal of the midterm is to take the concepts learned this far and apply them to make a game loop come to life.  A game loop has a player that is given an objective and once that is completed is rewarded.  In this case, the game will be physics driven.

You control a physics driven character, camera can be 1st or 3rd person.

By physics driven, i mean the character's motion is controlled via forces or velocity.  The character needs to navigate a 3d plane, jumping is not necessary.

There will be 4 objects in the game world, each with a goal destination that the player must push the object onto.  The player can push an object by making contact with said object and moving in the direction, or pressing space which brings up a power gauge.  If the player stops the gauge at the right part, the object will slide perfectly into the destination.  

EDIT: Each of the objects has a different weight! Demonstrate the ability to find the mass of the object, and use that to overcome dynamic friction and move said object.

Once the 3 objects are placed in their destination, the 4th object is unlocked.  It is positioned at the bottom a ramp, and needs to be pushed to the top of the ramp.

Once that is complete the assignment is done.  The player should be notified they completed the objective, and the final score will be given by the the time it took to complete the level.
